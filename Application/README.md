**Overview**

Before importing and building, it is necessary to reconfigure the applicationâ€™s address, size, and the vector table address. In this case, my main application only has basic functionality, such as blinking the LED on PC13 and printing logs through UART2.

**Modify CMakeLists.txt to generate bin file**

Add this code in end of file:

```cmake
add_custom_command(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_OBJCOPY} -O binary $<TARGET_FILE:${PROJECT_NAME}> ${PROJECT_NAME}.bin
    COMMENT "Generating ${PROJECT_NAME}.bin"
)
```

**Build**

Follow build bootloader guide in bootloader README file
